I’m a Physics graduate from the University of Sheffield with a strong background in machine learning, AI engineering, automation, and embedded systems. I build intelligent solutions to automate complex tasks, streamline workflows, and enable data-driven decisions across various domains.

### Core Skills:
- Advanced Python programming, C++, MATLAB, VHDL
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, CNNs, Transformers)
- AI Agents & LLM fine-tuning (GPT-based models, autonomous web agents)
- Automation (Playwright, dynamic form parsing, custom automation pipelines)
- Embedded Systems & IoT (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, drone autopilots, LoRaWAN)
- Data Engineering & Analysis (SQL, MongoDB, Apache Spark, Pandas, Dash, IBM Watson Studio)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV, YOLO, object detection, segmentation)
- Cloud & API Integration (IBM Cloud, OpenAI API, real-time data processing)
- Version Control (Git, GitHub)

### Key Projects:
- **Wildfire Detection IoT System**: Integrated machine learning with LoRaWAN sensors for real-time wildfire detection, featuring a live UI and predictive analytics using NASA FIRMS data.
- **Autonomous FPV Drone**: Custom-built drone system with an F7 flight controller, GPS navigation, PID tuning, and autonomous capabilities using iNav firmware.
- **Imagine You Flutter App**: Personalized image generation app leveraging custom-trained diffusion models deployed via Replicate API, Firebase backend, and responsive Flutter UI.
- **Automated LinkedIn Job Application Bot**: Python-based intelligent automation using Playwright and GPT-generated cover letters, dynamically handling web form inputs and file uploads.
- **Advanced PC Assistant Agent**: AI-powered CLI agent capable of system operations, file management, browser integration, task management, and HTTP traffic logging.
- **Falcon 9 Launch Outcome Prediction**: Data science project employing CRISP-DM methodology and machine learning models for predicting SpaceX mission outcomes.

I’m eager to connect and collaborate on innovative projects leveraging automation, AI, and system integration.
