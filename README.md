I'm a Physics graduate from the University of Sheffield with extensive experience in Python programming, machine learning, data science, and embedded systems. My work focuses on developing custom automation solutions, AI-driven workflows, and intelligent systems to streamline processes and tackle challenging technical problems.

Core Skills:
- Advanced Python programming, C++, MATLAB
- Machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- AI engineering, LLM fine-tuning, NLP
- Web automation (Playwright), autonomous AI agents
- IoT, embedded systems (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, drone autopilots)
- Data engineering, data visualization, SQL
- Version control with Git/GitHub

Key Projects:
- Wildfire detection IoT system integrating ML and LoRaWAN sensors
- Autonomous FPV drone development using custom-built hardware and iNav firmware
- Playwright-based automated job application bot for dynamic web form handling
- Falcon 9 launch outcome prediction using data science methodologies
- Imagine you Android app. Imagine yourself with custom made Diffusion models.
